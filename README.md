# XAI Interpretation with SHAP
### Author: Yufan Ai

This repository contains the code and resources for the first assignment in AIPI 590, focusing on Explainable AI (XAI) using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations). The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate the use of SHAP for interpreting the predictions of a machine learning model, specifically XGBoost, trained on the California Housing Dataset.

## Introduction

Inspired by the research paper "A Comprehensive Approach to Explainable AI: SHAP's Role in Modern Machine Learning," this assignment explores how SHAP can make complex models like XGBoost more interpretable. The analysis focuses on uncovering feature importance and interactions within the XGBoost model to provide transparent and understandable predictions.
